# Land_of_Misfit_Scripts
This repository holds really cool short scripts that are probably useful to others for specific tasks. They are so special that they get their own repository instead of being hidden deep within larger scripts. 

If you have some great code snippets, please add them to this repository as individual .R files (or .Rmd) with an indication of what they actually do in the file name. Consider a more detailed description at the top of the script and contact information if users have additional questions.
