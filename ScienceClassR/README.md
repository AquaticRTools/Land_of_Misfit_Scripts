This “Island of Misfit” Code is an R script I wrote for my wife’s science and math class. It has some interesting dplyr filter examples and ggplot boxplots with “jitter”.

# Jason R Hill - used code examples from Lou Reynolds and Emma Jones
# to create code for my wife's science and math classes.
# She called me a huge nerd - 'whatever'!
# Shows students how to make simple graphs and 
# How to calculate mean, median, and mode from made up test results
# Then I show them get the SOL "passrate" data from
# Department of Educaton and how to filter using
# plyr and dplyr and finally they make
# nicer graphs using ggplot2
To run the R code must have R version 3.3.1 and packages modest (2.1), plyr (1.8.4), dplyr (0.5.0), and ggplot2 (2.2.1)
