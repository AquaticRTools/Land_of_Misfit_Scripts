Test script for applying a custom function across a rolling window. I searched for hours to try to find this answer. Very useful for analyzing continuous monitoring data. 

Here I have applied a function for upstream/downstream temperature comparisons from paired USGS gages (script also shows a little of pulling NWIS data). The custom function is a simple one but great for demo purposes.
